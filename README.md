# simpa
`simpa` is a program for simple auditory classical conditioning.  
The `experiments` branch is the branch for the programs used to conduct experiments and the `analysis` branch is for data analysis obtained from the experiments.  
The `main` branch is a merge of these two.  
Switch between branched as needed.
